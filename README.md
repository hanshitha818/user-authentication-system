# User Authentication System for Office Environment

## Overview
A multi-factor authentication (MFA) system for office environments that combines login credentials, OTP verification, and real-time face recognition to strengthen access security.

## Problem
Traditional username/password authentication is vulnerable to credential theft and unauthorized access, especially in shared office environments.

## Solution
This system improves security by combining:
- Credential-based login
- OTP verification (second factor)
- Real-time face recognition (biometric factor)
- Auto-logout based on user inactivity

## Key Features
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA): credentials + OTP + face recognition
- Real-time face recognition verification
- Auto-logout on inactivity with session safety handling
- Improved access security and reduced exposure risks

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow (if used for face recognition pipeline)
- Flask
- OTP / Security APIs

## Outcomes
- Improved authentication security by ~95%
- Reduced data exposure risk by ~80% through inactivity-based auto logout
